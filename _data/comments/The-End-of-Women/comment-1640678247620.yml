message: "Its a wonder OP can be so knowledgably about evo psych and still understate female short term mating in our evolution by a few factors. I'd venture to say, that short-term copulation was more meaningful in our evolution than long-term pair bonding. This is due to war and disease. \r\n\r\nArguendo that LT is more favorable long-term (to what optimized end?); still does not answer the simple math: more variance means more fitness.  [\"Fisher found that the larger the variance in fitness, the faster the average growth of the population. Greater variation implies greater improvement and therefore faster growth.\"]\r\n\r\nSo women are the ones bluffing. They say they want a LT relationship (because of negative views of short term pair bonding historically.) But really want the top males (with the acumen to bluff back). And that is exactly what they are getting. \r\n\r\nHow other cultures lived is of no evidence. We live in unique times; with exponential GDP growth curves. And they are responding. The females are not hungry, nor are they unsheltered. its a marvel that people are still aghast at the current market. Get with it."
